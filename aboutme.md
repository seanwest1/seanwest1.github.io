subtitle: My Project Log & Learning Journey
---

Welcome! I'm Sean, living here in Frankston. I firmly believe in the power of learning by doing, and this website is my dedicated space to share that journey.

You'll find a growing collection of my personal projects here, showcasing how I approach different challenges and build practical solutions. As a Lab Tech for almost ten years, I've developed a keen eye for detail, problem solving and troubleshooting, all skills that serve me well as I delve deeper into the world of technology. 

The value of creation over consumption is a notion that I've come across online, and it's one that wholeheartedly agree with. From Seneca to Bj√∂rk.  This website is my own experiment in applying this philosophy, as work on projects that challenge me, help me learn and to grow.
