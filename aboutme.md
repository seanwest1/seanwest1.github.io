My name is Sean, I use my phone to consume a lot of things that quickly slip my mind. So I figured if I created something out of it I'd have something to show for it.

I noticed my ability to explain my thoughts is lacking, here is my attempt to practice this skill

### My story

- I live in Frankston with my family.
- I'm a highschool laboratory technician. 
- I'd love to get more sleep than I currently get but this is what I chose.
- Check my LinkedIn otherwise.
