Iâ€™m Sean, 

I live all the way out here in Frankston with:
- my family.
- a some books.
- a slightly sad ThinkPad.
- too many adapters and devices.
- my prized Matilda Buffalo lawn.

I like the idea of
- reading. On pause till my kids start to sleep through the night. ðŸ¤ž Sorry Kobo.
- making use of technology to solve problems like making sure the garage door is closed.

#### Why a website?
Around the time of the pandemic lockdowns my daughter was born. To my detriment I had ample but broken down time on my hands. So I started going on scroll based apps more and more. 

After a bit of denial I got my adult ADHD diagnosis and it all fell in to place. 

So to remedy this I figured I'd start trying to collect what is meaningful to me, instead of eating metaphorical Pringles from my phone, one after another until I feel sick.

I've decided more lasting and productive enjoyment can be gotten from making things.
