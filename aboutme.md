# About Me

Iâ€™m Sean.

I live out in Frankston with:
- my family
- some books
- a slightly sad ThinkPad
- too many adapters and devices
- my prized Matilda Buffalo lawn


I like the idea of:
- reading. Thatâ€™s on pause until my kids start sleeping through the night ðŸ¤ž Sorry Kobo.
- using technology to solve everyday problems, like making sure the garage door is closed.


I work as a high school Lab Tech and have spent more than a decade in scientific environments.

My background is in microbiology and biotechnology, and lately Iâ€™ve been getting into Python and open-source software as tools for solving new problems.

During the pandemic I caught myself relying too much on passive, scroll-based apps and decided to shift that time into something more constructive.

This site is my way of channelling ADHD into building, creating, and documenting projects. Itâ€™s where I try to turn new ideas into real work and share what I learn along the way.

I believe curiosity drives innovation, and my aim is to always be learning.

update - As of August 2025 I started to read a few kobo pages of "The Tartar Steppe" by Dino Buzzati before I go to sleep.
