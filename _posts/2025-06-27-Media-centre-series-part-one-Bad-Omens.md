It was a strange night. I probably should have seen it coming. The kids went to sleep too easily. I didn't question it; maybe it was just the time of year...

After my initial foray into media center setup, I was ready. I'd done some research and decided to use my **Raspberry Pi 400** as a central hub to serve media to all the devices on my network.

My past uses of a Raspberry Pi had been a little hit-and-miss â€” a few puffs of smoke from a short-circuit here, hours of googling to fix issues. But it remains one of my favorite hobbies. It sort of feels like **magic**, in a way: you can put your ideas into an inanimate object (write some code) and watch it do things in the physical world (motors, buzzers, lights, etc.).

Since my last project, a time-lapse photography rig using an old webcam, the setup process had been simplified with the **Raspberry Pi Imager** program, which handled some extra settings for you.

I picked an **SD card**, put it in my laptop, and selected my operating system (**OS**). Raspberry Pi usually runs a **Linux OS**, as opposed to the more consumer-popular Windows or Mac.

The **lite** version of the official **Raspberry Pi OS** doesn't have a **GUI** (graphical user interface), or the desktop you see on most computers. You use the computer using written commands. I don't use it often enough to not need to look up commands constantly, but when you get used to it, it feels really cool, like you're a **hacker**. In fact, when you're used to it, it's actually quicker than using a mouse.

I didn't want to connect the Pi to a monitor and keyboard. So, I turned on the power, and within a minute, the Pi started up, connected to my **Wi-Fi**, and I connected to it from my laptop.

Then, weirdly, the thing just worked. First time... **Bad omen**. It never just works; I'd be paying for this somehow.

I had my setup guides open, and everything was going well. The **terminal** (where you give commands and receive output from the computer) was cooperating. And if I really got stuck, I could dump the error message into ChatGPT.

I got into a **flow state**, having so much fun that I didn't realize how late it was getting. I set up a basic **firewall** because a guide suggested it, installed a program to make it easier to transfer files from other computers, and then finally installed a **media player** program. I tested it out with some files on a USB.

I can't emphasize how strange it was that it just worked.

**And then my luck had run out. The tide was turning. I had gotten my feet wet in the seemingly safe rock pools, not thinking I'd have to swim.**

I had skipped a step in the firewall setup because I didn't understand it... Now I couldn't transfer media from my laptop to the Pi because of that very same firewall.

I went back and read what the guide said. It was fixable.

**I turned around to look at the sea; the horizon was gone. Next I knew, I was smashed back into hard, rocky reality.**

I heard my son start crying out, confused and congested. He had only gone to bed so easily because he was worn out from a day at childcare and a virus he'd picked up there.

I had to abandon my project for the night just as I worked out what I'd done wrong.

The next day was only made possible though caffeine and strategic pushup `breaks`.
