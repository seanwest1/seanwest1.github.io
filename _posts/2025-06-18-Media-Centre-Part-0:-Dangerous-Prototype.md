Have you ever looked forward to watching something and forgot which streaming service it's on, who has the login, or if the title has just disappeared from the catalog?

Well, I wanted to watch *Alien*. It just happened to not be on Australian streaming at the time.

NEVER AGAIN!!!

I could have probably found the DVD or obtained it in some other way, but that was beside the point.

A bit of Googling, a few options came up. The first ones that were satisfactory for me involved using an old PC or Android device. Leaving my laptop on all the time seemed like overkill.
I read a blog post about the DLNA protocol. A standard that meant it was possible to stream media between two devices seemed like a great fit. So I dug out a midrange Samsung phone from 2017, connected it to a dock which allowed USB drives to be connected. It was able to stream to the TV or my Pixel without any hiccups over our Wi-Fi somehow. I thought it would have hit some bottleneck, but it had enough power to play video locally on my network (between devices that were connected to my Wi-Fi and wired network within my home).

For a few weeks, the phone worked well. I converted a few DVDs to video files with no issues. But I didn't trust the phone with its at least 8-year-old battery to not expand or leak given its age. Also, getting the device to work without its battery seemed like a bit too much work, compounded by the fact some corrosion had caused intermittent notifications that warned of water in the USB-C port. I also noted that some video formats weren't usable. My temporary solution was okay, but I always like to tinker if I know there are other options.

It got me thinking about some other DIY systems I'd seen online in my previous search. There were some very capable setups using a Raspberry Pi (a compact computer that was contained within one circuit board, minus the screen, mouse, and keyboard). I had one in storage that I hadn't been using.
And that's where I'm at at the moment. Hoping to document my progress and be a guide or cautionary tale to someone else.

In the time covered by my initial annoyance and writing this, I've found that I can indeed stream them at the moment... But now I have a project.
