# Research project

### Setting the scene
Recently an attempt by someone to log into it prompted me to change my password to my long neglected Dropbox account.

I was glad that they did. As I probably would have lost an interesting time capsule from 
a transitionary time in my life, I was moving out of home and I started to in a way move away from my laptop as the place where I exclusively did work and integrated cloud based services like Google docs.

I decided to take a look around, then there it was, the original of my university research project. It had been a bullet point on every version of my resume since but I'd never really shown it to anyone.

Thinking about it now, I'm pulled back to the time when it was written. The due date was at a strange time in the exam period. I was very burnt out from exam revision. The whole experience was as best I can describe it , brain frying. Probably the result of too much time inside, without enough water, real food or exercise.

It felt extra ethereal because my lab partner and I would work in the computer labs till the campus library closed, while security would herd everyone outside. They would do a sweep and check everything was in order, check student IDs, then allow everyone back inside. 

One night I remember distinctly, it was about 1am everyone was waiting to get back into the library. Someone was arguing with the security guard about getting back in as soon as possible because he left something in there, trying to push his way past, making the process take longer.

I sat in the cold with my McDonald's in the  artificial twilight created by the campus lighting, people smoking around the corner created an atmosphere that made the harsh LED lighting diffuse and softer, the incessant muffled sounds of the on campus advertising for the different services the University offered created a babbling brook for me to rest my weary brain. This all combined with sleep deprivation to form an _ersatz_ form of contentment and relaxation.

I felt comfortably removed from that now. The pain of reading my own writing was gone. Especially now that the thing had been finalised years prior.
## The lab work.
The subject of our project had to be something timely or relevant of recent research that had been fine. 

At the time there was a contamination incident in Germany that had spread across several EU countries. It had lead to multiple deaths and caused a massive over haul of the industry.

The pathogen at the heart of the outbreak was a strain of *E.Coli* capable of producing a toxin when under stress.

_E. coli_ are normally harmless bacteria that live in the guts of mammals and are considered essential to normal digestion, but some acquire new genes from other bacteria giving them different abilities (like making toxin). Their presence on food generally suggests recent faecal contamination.

Looking back I probably would have elected to choose a less specific topic. But we were sort of encouraged by supervisors to follow this direction. Because *E.coli* would give distinctive results and are well understood and researched.

We began by getting samples from some washed and ready to eat salad leaves and putting onto some Petri dishes with nutrients and a thick jelly like substance for them to grow on and in to. 

After these grew one of us came back about 48 hours later to make observations and put the plates in the fridge for the next session.

Over the next few sessions we would pick off different colonies of bacteria and put them on new plates and seperate them so we would only grow Petri dishes of the same bacteria. Along the way we would subject the bacterial colonies to traditional microbiological tests 

### Traditional microbiological tests
The marking rubric required a variety of tests using traditional methods where physical characteristics are tested) like what they can metabolise (use for fuel), how they react to different chemicals, what they looked like under the microscope and what their blob on the petri dish (the colony that grows from sampled bacteria) looked like. 

We followed some standard tests that would give us quick answers to indicate if it was likely that _E.coli_ was there. No luck, but we were able to grow a few distinct looking colonies from the sample. 

Then we could move on to the part we had been learning about in the biotechnology courses, techniques working directly with DNA.

### Molecular techniques

You are probably familiar but to simplify, for the purposes of this explanation DNA can be thought of as a ladder. The longer outer two poles are made up of two very long molecules. Between them are the base pairs, the base pairs are made up of specific molecules that only join to each other in specific pairs, I'll shorten them and say that A joins to T and C joins to G. So it makes a ladder, in practice the DNA is never flat inside the cell it is usually folded up as much as possible.

|A-T|
|C-G|
|G-C|
|T-A|

#### Lab based molecular techniques:

First DNA had to be extracted from our carefully selected bacterial colonies. Then we moved to the two broad molecular techniques. Ones that techniques accessible to us in a teaching laboratory. DNA size (how many rungs the ladder had) and another the pattern of distinctive fragmentation of DNA sequences when chemically cut (how long the pieces of the ladder were).

The other technology we would get results from was much more fine and was at the scale of individual letters that made up the DNA (The order of the letters that made up the rungs), it involved sending our samples to a specialised facility.

The less precise tests involving sizes of DNA fragments, we could do these in the lab. 
In order To get quantities of DNA we needed for our experiments required a process called PCR (polymerase chain reaction). PCR mimics the way DNA is copied naturally but in a compressed timeframe sped up by artificial temperature and chemical conditions.

For our experiments we we used a process called gel electrophoresis where by under the right conditions DNA can be moved with electricity. To make the DNA travel slowly for analysis you can force it to travel through a slab of purified seaweed extract. When the extract is dissolved in hot water and allowed to cool it forms a more rigid jelly like substance with tiny pores. If you get the ratio wrong, the gel can fall apart or can be too dense for the DNA to move through at all or in a satisfactory time.

What can be exploited for the purposes of analysis is that the size of the pieces of DNA. Smaller pieces travel faster though the small holes in the gel while larger fragments are more likely to get caught so take longer.

The DNA samples placed into small indentations in the gel, the power is turned on and you wait for the DNA to migrate. So when measured against DNA of a known size (a solution you buy and put in an adjacent hole in the gel) you can estimate the size of fragments you have from your sample using a ruler and some simple ratio calculations.

A combination of the two techniques (PCR and gel electrophoresis) was used to detect the presence of a toxin gene.  In this version of PCR we could make many copies of a specific gene. If the gene wasn't present the selective PCR would not produce anything. 

We then put our samples on the gel and we found that the bacteria did have the gene for the toxin because our selective PCR process made copies of the gene and the gel showed that a fragment had been made at the size expected for the gene for making the toxin.

It should be noted that the gene itself doesn't indicate the presence of the toxin, it's more like the bacterial DNA has the instructions for making the toxin stored in it.

 The second one we did in the lab was a type of genetic barcode. In a large group of bacteria called Enterobacteriaceae one that includes *E.coli*, there are regions of DNA that have repeating sequences in them. Special enzymes can be used to cut DNA at specific sequences (if there is CTAGA for example). When these regions of DNA are cut up and run on gel electrophoresis, the fragment sizes created are unique for different strains of bacteria. So later the fragments of DNA look like a bit like a barcode, that's unique to each strain.

#### DNA sequencing 

The phenomenon in nature exploited in these specific tests was that there are parts of DNA that are less subject to change that others.

The genes sequenced in this part are special. They control the making of proteins by bacteria. Because a defective step in creating proteins will be fatal to that genetic lineage they are fairly stable. If over the course of time a mutation arises that is not a disadvantage or is actually an advantage it will stay in the population.

But the probability is low that one of the last two mutations will occur. This means that over time that protein will change slightly but also slowly and each genetic lineage will be unique to each other.

In order to get the DNA from our samples we had to follow some strict protocols to prevent contamination. Basically we had to break the cells open, use an expensive mix of detergents, chemicals and cool temperature to ensure the DNA wasn't destroyed by the cell contents.  This process is necessary as the bacterial cells have evolved to destroy stray DNA strands as they usually come from viruses. The DNA all safely purified and safe was then sent off to the sequencing facility.

About a week later we received files that contained the most likely sequence of the DNA that we had provided. We were then able to play around with a program that would match the sequence to a massive database of the protein synthesis gene of other bacterial species that had been identified.

I enjoyed doing the sequencing part of the experiment. Because there was an element of problem solving and having to make a call based on slightly ambiguous information. 

### Reflections
We were lucky as we got some unambiguous results as to which bacteria we had isolated, other got contaminated or results that were at odds with what their traditional microbiological tests suggested they had isolated from their samples.

In essence, our findings were that we didn't detect *E.coli* in the samples. Our other findings were that two of these bacterial species had the genes needed to produce the toxin from the incident in Germany. 

The conclusion we drew was that this sample was safe to eat. But since I've always thought twice about "ready to eat salad" and for about a year after I always washed my spinach before using.

The bacteria that we had identified were called _Pseudomonas koreensis_ , commonly found in agricultural soil, and *Aeromonas media*, a bacterium that is comfortable living in the environment and inside the gut of animals but has also been linked so diarrhoea in humans. 

Now looking back on the whole experience I can see why some parts of it were rushed. Over the course of a semester every once a fortnight on a Thursday everyone in the class would go into the laboratory and try and get as much work done as possible before the lab demonstrator would have to go home for the day.
