## Time constraints and setbacks.

Since the events of part one, my son had brought home multiple viruses and was unhappy about his new teeth coming through. There wasn't much to do except comfort him and give him ibuprofen and paracetamol.

It meant that I got to spend a bit of time with him. He would want to cuddle with me while sitting on the couch but would also demand to be carried most times I walked away from him.

## Back to the drawing board

During this time I couldn't get all my electronics out because he would be interested in what I was doing and try and help in his own way.

So I just stuck to researching on my phone when possible. 

I decided on OSMC (Open Source Media Centre). It runs a user interface (set of menus and controls) called KODI.  OSMC is one of the more popular media centre choices for the Raspberry Pi.

OSMC takes care of a lot of the more complicated setup and features automatically.

## The setup 

When my son was sleeping properly again I got the memory card I used previously and put OSMC onto it and got ready with a blog post someone had written about it. 

The post was a recently published writeup that I'd be able to follow to the letter as it wouldn't contain outdated instructions from software changes. 
## The pay off, rewards and unexpected features

The software was great, it was compatible with all the media files I had. The developers had made it so when you turn on your Raspberry Pi, it starts up without the need for a password or intimidating looking command line interfaces. 

It turned out that the best solution for my use case was to connect my Raspberry Pi directly to the TV with a HDMI cord like a DVD player and allow my other devices like phones and tablets to access the media connected to the Raspberry Pi via Wi-Fi. One feature I was very surprised to see was CEC (Consumer Electronic Control) was able to control the Raspberry Pi which meant that my normal Samsung TV remote could navigate the KODI menus instead of me using a keyboard.

At the time of writing (mid July) I'm yet to find any issues with this set up. 

## Lessons learned 

The hiccups and time constraints were a blessing in disguise. It meant I had to reconsider my situation and actual needs.
With new software tools or systems, if possible you should start with the most simple solution, allowing for room to grow, **then** move on if you out grow it.

If I had made something more complex I'd feel obliged to use it rather than it being the asset it is now. I finished up with a set up that was close to the original phone based solution in part 0.

More generally I was reminded of some painfully obvious but easily neglected truths.
- Always read the instructions.
- Sleep is very important.
