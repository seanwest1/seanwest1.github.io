Recently, I wanted to get better at taking photos with my phone. After all, it's basically always in my pocket. Generally, my strategy is to point and shoot, then crop and adjust photos later. This is less of an option with macro photographs, which are my favourite.

Macro photos are interesting to me because, even though you can see the details of the subject with the naked eye, they take on new dimensions.

[This website](https://www.adobe.com/au/creativecloud/photography/discover/macro-photography.html#:~:text=Macro%20photography%20is%20all%20about,are%20examples%20of%20macro%20photography.)  defines them as photos that represent a subject larger than they are in real life. Specifically, I like taking pictures of fungi because of how alien they seem. They are the macroscopic manifestation of a network of microscopic cells working together. It mixes my interest and knowledge of microbiology in a more tangible way. This year wasn't the best for mushrooms and toadstools as it didn't quite rain enough at the correct times. I still managed to get some photos.

#### The problem 

My current phone a Pixel 6 Pro, had one of the better cameras on the market in 2021. To my surprise, even with the array of sensors, there wasn't a combination that could specifically take macro photos. 
So for once I resisted the urge to impulse buy something from Amazon to fix the issue. Before my current phone, I had a Huawei P40, which had a partnership with Leica, a well regarded German optics brand, this meant it had an impressive array of sensors and functionality. It did take good macro photos and offered some suggestions for what type of photo it believed was being taken.

#### Technical fixes

First, I tried improving other things that were more in my control. On the software side I installed [Open Camera](https://opencamera.org.uk/) , an Open Source camera app that would give me more fine grained control over the operation of the sensors. The default camera app for Pixel is good but it is also integrated with different algorithms that box you in. The Open Camera app let me manually set the focal length rather than what the phone decided for me. This improved things slightly.

The next challenge came when I found the camera had a restrictive focusing distance. The device was suited to taking photos of people and things much farther away. According to some Reddit posts I could either use the 2X or 4X optical zoom into the subject for my photo while keeping a distance. Optical zoom is achieved by movement of lenses within the camera, as opposed to digital zoom that crops the image. Or I could get closer and use an optical zoom less than 2X. I read that under 2X zoom only one of the sensors is used giving a slightly better image at that magnification.

Still frustrated having to kneel down as close as possible to toadstools, I decided to look at clip on lenses to give my camera a little magnification boost. The options online were not well received  by users for the amount of money I was willing to pay. 

Later that week at Kmart, I saw a  tripod for sale at half the usual price. I'd read that this could help with some techniques but disregarded it until now. I could use a combination of the low light mode where the camera stacks images on top of each other.

To augment these gains, I could use what photographers call **golden hour**, the time just after sunrise and just before sunset when the sun's light is bright enough, but also warm and diffuse.The tripod came in handy because in low light mode if the phone moves at all you are likely to get blurry photos. It came with a Bluetooth shutter button, letting me position the camera perfectly and not need to touch it to take the picture. With these technical limitations reduced, I started looking at composition rules.

**Late addition at the time of editing.**
Then finally, I saw that my phones wide angle lens can give a decent impression of a macro photo. This is created by physically moving the lense backwards into the phone, slightly skewing the image. As seen in the image if the insect above.
#### Photography techniques

I chose to focus on these techniques because they made the most sense to me.

- Rule of thirds 
- Negative space
- leading lines
- Symmetry 

I turned on the grid lines on my camera and tried to use the **rule of thirds**.

​For the rule of thirds grid: ![An image showing the rule of thirds grid .](/assets/img/rule-of-thirds-grid.jpg)

It makes points in the image where some grid lines intersect. To my beginner's eye, it made all the difference. Then when I looked at other visually appealing photos online, I started to see it everywhere.

Previously, I'd always plop the subject in the middle of the frame and not really pay attention to the rest. The idea is to line up points of interest with the lines and the points they  intersect. For me, it was a good rule of thumb for photos in general. It aligned with the way that people naturally look at images. It also gives context to the scene, with action or movement and is augmented by the next two ideas.

 Building on the rule of thirds was **Negative Space**, using the other parts of the image to draw attention to the subject by contrast.

For example a picture with the subject in the bottom right intersection of the lines. The bottom horizontal line is a good place to have the horizon. The sky by virtue of being less detailed, makes the image look more balanced.

Another allied idea is **leading lines**, for example the natural lines and patterns within the environment like sticks and leaves to direct the viewer's eye toward the subject of the image. Like the skyline in the above example.

**Symmetry** was another thing I didn't think about. I always focused on the placement of the subject. Like negative space, it uses the way the environmental contrast to draw attention to the subject, but in a different way. The ​subject is in center of the image rather than the viewer being led to it. Then the contrast comes from a detailed, repeating pattern. It could be thought of as creating visual balance through different lines of the photo. For example the symmetrical petals of a flower radiating outwards, contrasted against a blurred or natural looking background.


P.S
When researching what my phone could do, I found that earlier this year Google pushed an update that allows for **astrophotography**. 

It uses a combination of very long exposure times, changing the focal length to infinite and some software to adjust for movements of the earth.

These long exposure times required the use of a tripod which I had purchased.

My first few attempts were plagued by clouds, light pollution from Frankston, and Melbourne and bugs seeking out the light from the phone screen.

On a particularly clear night I managed to find a patch of sky that stayed clear for the recommended 5 minutes. While there was only about 5 or 6 points of light I could see unaided, there was hundereds of stars and objects in the photo. 

The camera captured a stop motion movie for me showing the movement of the Earth and also a motion corrected single picture of that area of sky.

In future, I'd like to get to a more rural area over night and capture the Milky Way or some planets.
