It was a strange night, I probably should have seen it comming. The kids went to
sleep too easily. I didn't question it, maybe it was just the time of the year...

After my initial forey into media centre set up I was ready. I did some research
I'd decided to have my Raspberry pi 400 as a central hub where I could serve media 
to all the devices on my network. 

My past uses of a raspberry pi had been a little hit and miss, some little puffs of smoke from a short-circuit or taping away at a keyboard and googling solutions for hours to fix issues. But it still remains one of my favourite hobbies, it sort of feels like magic in a way, you can put your ideas into an inanimate object (write some code) and it can do things in the physical world (motors, buzzers, lights etc)

Since my last project, a time lapse photography rig using an old webcamera, the setup process had been simplified with the "raspberry pi imager" program which handled some extra settings for you.

I picked an SD card and put it in my laptop and selected my operating system (OS). Raspberry pi usually runs a Linux OS as opposed to the more popular with consumers Windows or Mac.

The lite version of the official raspberry pi OS doesn't have what's called a GUI 
(graphical user interface) or the desktop you see on most computers. You use the computer using 
written commands. I don't use it often enough to not need to look up commands constantly, but when you get used to it it feels really cool, like to are a hacker. When you get used to it, it is actually quicker than using a mouse.

I didn't want to connect up the pi to a monitor and keyboard. So I turned on the power and within a minute the Pi started up, connected to my WIFI and I connected to it from my laptop. 

Then weirdly, the thing just worked. First time... Bad omen, it never
just works, I'd be paying for this somehow.

I had my setup guides open, everything was going well the terminal (where you 
give commands and recive output from the computer) was all working for me. 
And if I really got stuck I could dump there error message into chat gpt.

I got into a flow state, I was having fun so I didn't realise it was getting late, I set up a basic firewall
because a guide suggested it, I installed a program to make it easier to transfer
files from other computers, then finally I installed a media player program, tested it out with some files on a USB.

I can't emphasive how strange it was that it just worked.

** And then my luck had run out, the tide was turning. I had gotten my feet wet, in the seemingly safe rock pools not thinking I'd have to swim. **

I had skipped a step in the firewall setup because I didn't understand it....  Now I couldn't use the software the transfer media from my laptop to the pi. 

I went back and read what the guide said. Was fixable.

The was a little noise, nothing to work about.

** I turned around to look at the sea, the horizon was gone. Next I knew I was smashed back into hard rocky reality **

 I heard my son start crying out, confused and congested. He had only went to bed so easily because he was worn out from a day at childcare and a virus he'd picked up there.

I had to abandon my project for the night just as I worked out what I'd done wrong.

The next day was very much a write off.
