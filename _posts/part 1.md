It was a strange night, I probably should have seen it comming. The kids went to
sleep too easily and early.

After my initial forey into media centre set up I was ready. I did some research
I'd decided to have my Raspberry pi 400 as a central hub where I could serve media 
to all the devices on my network. 

The Rasperry pi, despite being a self contained computer doesn't have storage of
its own. You have to install everything onto external storage devices like memory 
cards and USB sticks and plug it in. So I got my memory card and intalled the 
"Lite" version of an operating system. 

This process is a lot easier now that there is software that will let you choose
from a list of recomended opperating systems that are compatible with it. Most of
these operating systems are based on Linux as opposed to the more popular with 
consumers Windows or Mac.

The lite version of the operating system doesn't have what's called a GUI 
(graphical user interface) or a dsektop environment. You use the computer using 
written commands. I figured I would need to save as many resources as possible 
if I was going to get the little computer to do all that work.

Within a minute the Pi started up, connected to my WIFI and I connected to it 
from my laptop. 

The mystery deepened, the thing just worked. First time... Bad omen, it never
just works, I'd be paying for this somehow.

I had my setup guides open, everything was going well the terminal (where you 
give commands and recive output from the computer) was all working for me. 
And if I really got stuck I could dump there error message into chat gpt.

was having fun so I didn't realise it was getting late, I set up a basic firewall
because a guide suggested it, I installed a program to make it easier to transfer
files from other computers, then finally I installed a media player program.

I can't emphasive how strange it was that there wasn't any errors.

And then there was, I had skipped a step in the firewall setup, was too cautious
now I couldn't use the software the transfer media from my laptop to the pi.

And then it started, my son only went to be so easily because he was starting to 
get sick. 

I had to abandon my project just as I worked out what I'd done wrong.
